# Executive summary for group-2-final-assignment

## 1. Overall features of the dataset
- Data needs to be cleaned before analysis (e.g., country, value of salary in different currencies, etc.)
- Most variables are discrete instead of continuous

## 2. Key takeaways from analysis performed
- The majority of the data are from US compared to other countries
- There are more female instances than male
- Most participants are aged 25-44
- Computing and Tech is the dominant industry
- White is the dominant race, probably because US is the dominant country in this survey
- Gender pay gap (man > woman) is the lease significant in the age group 18-24 in the UK, while most significant in age group 55-64. In UK, women during 18-24 do not earn differently from men in statistical sense.
